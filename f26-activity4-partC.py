# SCENARIO
# A weather station has recorded temperatures over seven days. 
# Your task is to examine the data and produce a short weather report.

# TODO 0: Create the variables you need for total temperature, # of days above 23 degrees, and hottest day
totalTemperature = 0
daysAbove23 = 0
hottestDay = -1

# TODO 1: Iterate through every recorded temperature

for x in temperatures:
  totalTemperature += x
  if x > hottestDay:
    hottestDay = x
  if x > 23:
    daysAbove23 +=1


    # TODO 2: Print the recorded temperature

    # TODO 3: Add the temperature to total

    # TODO 4: If temperature is above 23, add 1 to the day counter

# TODO 5: Calculate and print the average temeprature for the week.

# TODO 6: Print how many days exceeded 23 degrees

# TODO 7: Print the -> index <- of the highest temperature.
